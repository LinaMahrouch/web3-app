# A Web 3 app with solidity 
I created a web3 app with Solidity and ReactJs that is a cookie exchange website :)  where users can send me cookies and have them stored on the blockchain via an ethereum smart contract.
# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
